Website Designed for All Glazing Solutions
===========================================
Project Description
-------------------
I have created the front end design of a website for the company All Glazing Solutions, the idea of the site is for intrested customers to be able to find the company, see what they offer and view previous work,
as well as being able to submit enquiries through a form or by contacting the relevant staff at the company.

At the top of the page you will find a nav bar with the company logo and anchor points to each of the sections of the webpage, the anchors are stored in a hamburger menu when in mobile view. The nav bar is fixed so will stay on the page
whilst moving through the sections for easy access to each section.

The home section consists of the company logo as well as the company name and a small text.

The about us (services) section provides a short paragraph about the company and two boxes showing what the company 'fits' and what services the company offers, these boxes appear side by side in laptop and tablet viewing but appear one
above the other in mobile view.

The galllery section offers the customer a chance to view previous work which has been carried out by the company, these are split into two groups of 'Bifolding Doors' and 'Roof Lanterns', 'Bifolding Doors' is located above the 'Roof Lanterns'
for each viewing platform. for laptop or computer viewing the images will be shown in a grid with three pictures per line, for tablets and mobiles these are one picture across the page with the others stacked below. Heights of the pictures
are adjusted for each platform. For each platform there will originally be shown three photos of each group, in order to view more there is a 'click to see more button' under each group which will load up the rest of the photos if clicked,
once clicked a see less button will also appear with the extra pictures, when this is clicked the extra photos will hide again.

The contact us section shows an email and a phone number for two employees of the company, there is also an enquiry form which contains a name, phone number, email, address, enquiry type and description fields, all the fields are required.
The phone number field requires numbers in an eleven digit format, the enquiry type is a drop down selction box with 'service', 'installation only', 'supply only', 'supply & install' and other aas options. The description box has no limit for
text. There is a submit button for when the form is filled in which will send the details of the enquiry form over to an employee through a third party. An error message will appear if the form is attempted to be submitted without a certain
field supplied, the message will notify which field is missing.

At the bottom of the page is a footer with the copyright licence.

How To install and run
----------------------
The site will be able to be accessed by through a custom domain name which will be shown once the site has been uploaded to a hosting platform.

Known bugs
----------
The design and colours of the site are altered on samsung browsers, from research i do not belive there is a way around the samsung browser 'dark mode' without the user having to adjust settings which cannot be expected.
The back end role of the site will be handled by the websites hosting platform.
